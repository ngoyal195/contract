    <h1>Feelings? Fuck these emotions!</h1>

    <p>
        Ekdam unexpected. Atleast not to this extent. I am just watching time now, every second is feeling so heavy. But theek hai, tune mind mein decision banaya hai. You were my last hope with a lot of expectations. Mujhe pata hai you are also not feeling any good. When you cleared chat, I still had hope ki we will talk again, then when I saw "Last seen a long time ago", my brain just stopped thinking. But I am OK. Even if I am not, I will be OK in the end, and if I don't get OK, then it might be the end from you but not from me. But mai tujhe bother nahi karunga. I have always wished good for you. I wish you get all the happiness and success you desire for.
