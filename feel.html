    <h1>Feelings? Fuck these emotions!</h1>

       August 08. 2025 12:59PM.
    Sabkuch bekaar lag raha hai. No meaning. Ekdam unexpected. I didn't expect that things would come to this extent. I am just looking at the time now since morning, every second is feeling so heavy. But theek hai, tune mind mein decision banaya hai. You were my last hope with a lot of expectations. Mujhe pata hai you are also not feeling any good. When you cleared chat, I still had hope ki we will talk again, then when I saw "Last seen a long time ago", my brain just stopped thinking. But I am OK. Even if I am not, I will be OK in the end, and if I don't get OK, then it might be the end from you but not from me. But mai tujhe bother nahi karunga. Tune mujhe humesha vishwaas dilwaaya ki tu kahi nahi jaaygi. Ab tu chali gayi hai? Kaise? Kyun? Jab tak tere paas mera number saved hai, I will wait for you here. Jab tu number bhi delete kardegi, mai accept kar lunga mai tere liye kuch nahi hu. I have always wished good for you. I wish you get all the happiness and success you desire for.
